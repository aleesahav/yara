A pair of worn drumsticks.

I never got to return these, and I doubt I ever will.

I stole them, yeah—as vengeance for putting me in a position I didn’t think Rune ever would. And I wasn’t even mad at him for what he did. I was just… shocked. So stealing his drumsticks was me being petty.

But… I didn’t think I’d never see him again after that night…
