A blue iridescent Queen chess piece made of ivory.

I've had this for so long, that I can hardly remember if I stole it or if Aoi gave it to me. I'd like to think the latter, only because since it's made of ivory, it's probably so old that it was apart of a set that was passed down through generations. And it's a shame, really, to have this piece, making the set incomplete... It makes me guilty just holding it in my hands.

I guess what makes me feel even more guilty, is that the rare moments I do think of Aoi, I can't remember his face or his voice at all. It's when I dream about the blue and white foam of the ocean, I wake up remembering him, feeling like he was there in my dream.

I often wonder if I ever cross his path, would I even recognize him?
