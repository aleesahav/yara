An old, chipped guitar pick with a custom engraving that reads: *Y – Keep shredding – R.*

It was the first birthday I had after Rune and I became friends. He was always so much more sentimental than I was, so he had this custom made for me. I still remember him saying he wanted me to remember him whenever I played the guitar, since he was the one who taught me.

Why I held on to this after what happened between us is a mystery to me. I don’t even use it to play the guitar… I just can’t get rid of it, no matter how much I try.

I guess I’ve been sentimental all this time. He’d laugh at me if he realized how far I carried this. Maybe that’s why I still carry it.
