A black matte butterfly knife.

I found this Artifact before I even fully knew about the anomalous world. I was working a shift at the surplus store on Haight Street. It was late at night, and I was bored out of my mind, so I was re-arranging the display case at the register. I found, hidden underneath scraps of clothing, this butterfly knife. 

It called to me. When I touched it, I felt <em>something</em>, and it clung to me. When I flipped it open by pure instinct, my own long shadow cast by the street lights outside seemed to *dance*. Then, I found I could *control* my shadow to move and mold how I wanted to, but at the cost of being stuck in place. 

I quickly learned I could cloak myself in my own shadow to hide and move. Just like that, I could infiltrate places and spaces without anyone knowing. 

I stole it, and no one ever knew. No one probably looked for it. Now, it's considered an unregistered artifact. No one knows that it's mine. It's the artifact that knows me much more than the one that Aether West assigned me, and <em>definitely</em> knows me better than the fucking Morningstar Flail artifact that Darkwick assigned me.
