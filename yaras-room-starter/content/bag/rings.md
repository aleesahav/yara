Two 10K simple gold wedding rings with matching engravings: *MA ♡ RA*. One of them has a very small diamond inlay.

My parents died when I was away at summer camp. A child protective services social worker came to get me and placed me in temporary foster care. The social workers only gave me these that night and told me that my parents both died in a fatal car crash, their bodies so mangled that they could not see them. Said it was too horrible for a kid to see. They wouldn't even show me pictures. They wouldn't even let me see the car. Nothing. 

All the more reason why I was so suspicious of their death. I know the truth, that they died to the *Atricordis*, and if I hadn't been so sloppy in the way that I eliminated it, I would still have the evidence with me to prove it...

The AII was hiding more than the Atricordis, though. I'm still trying to understand what they are hiding.

Anyway, the rest of our belongings from the apartment we lived in were released to me when I turned eighteen. I didn’t want to look through any of our old things, so I had them put into storage somewhere in San Francisco, where I’m still paying the storage unit’s monthly rent…
