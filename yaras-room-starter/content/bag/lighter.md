A gold-colored Zippo lighter with *MA* engraved at the edge.

The lighter originally belonged to my grandfather, Mariano, and it was the only thing my father had of his own father. I guess since I carry it around now, it can be considered a family heirloom.

It’s not real gold, of course, and it’s a cheap thing, really. But since I never knew my father’s father—and I don’t have my father anymore—this lighter has enough spirit in it to make me feel like I’m carrying them both. Something about the engraving of *MA*, and sharing the same initials as my father and my father’s father, makes it feel like this is mine just as much as it was theirs.

I’m not technically Mayari Avendaño anymore, since the Du Verres had my name legally changed to Yara Du Verre when they adopted me, but it feels like my little secret.
