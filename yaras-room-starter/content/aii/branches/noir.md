Hidden in the ruins of a monastery deep within the Transylvanian wilderness, **Academiei Noire** serves as the most clandestine of the Anomalous Investigation Institute’s elite field training grounds. Unlike its academic sister schools, Noire does not cater to theorists or researchers, and many outsiders believe the academy itself to be a myth. It exists solely to forge operatives—those who face the unspeakable and return changed.

Rumored to be the Institute’s most brutal and rigorous facility, Noire is an austere, militarized campus tasked with preparing agents for the most volatile and unsanctioned anomaly operations in the Western world.

Clad in gothic stone and shadowed by ancient pine forests, Noire resembles a fortress more than a school. Its battlements still bear the scars of past exorcisms and failed sealings. Cadets train alongside near-corrupted artifacts, engage in live combat simulations against replicated anomalies, and are indoctrinated into the darker reaches of anomaly warfare through the study of forbidden grimoires on demonology, ritual bindings, blood curses, and occult conditioning techniques few are ever meant to know.

Those who survive Noire are deployed into global black ops teams and special anomaly response units.

Little is known to the public about Academiei Noire beyond its nearly impossible admissions process—recruiting only 100 cadets per year, often from within the AII’s most promising sister schools—and its harrowingly high attrition rate. What *is* known, however, is this: its operatives are bound by unmatched loyalty, spiritual conditioning, and the kind of cohesion only born from shared trauma.

## Orders

Within its walls, there are no traditional Houses. Instead, cadets are assigned to **Combat Orders**, each rooted in monastic tradition and tailored to a specific doctrine of anomaly engagement. Each Order bears its own rites, combat philosophy, and historical mandate.

- **Ordo Corvinus** — Leaders and tacticians; front-line operatives known for discipline, sacrifice, high-stakes suppression, and taking command where no one else can.

- **Ordo Focului** — Bruisers and breachers; physically hardened cadets trained for breach combat, artifact recovery, and pain endurance, valuing power over polish.

- **Ordo Umbrae** — Stealth specialists and spiritual assassins, tasked with cleanup, vanishing anomalies, and eliminating possessed operatives.

- **Ordo Moarte** — Death-touched medics and corpse sanctifiers who handle plague anomalies, battlefield recovery, and necromantic containment.
