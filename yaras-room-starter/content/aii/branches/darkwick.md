On its own artificial island in Tokyo Bay, with perfect views of the Rainbow Bridge, this anomalous island is home to Darkwick Academy. With grounds that stretch out for miles and are surrounded on all sides by thick woods, the whole campus is an anomaly in itself—it appears far more spacious inside than it does from the mainland. Stone paths wind through colorful flower beds across lush green grass. At the center of the fields stands a glittering fountain. The main building rises like a gothic castle, and within it lies a vast entry hall lined with marble pillars beneath an ornately decorated ceiling and embroidered plush carpets.

While Darkwick is known to civilians as an illustrious private academy with a selective and secretive admissions process—its campus strictly prohibiting civilian entry—within the AII it is regarded as the largest and most prestigious branch in anomalous research and education, consistently ranked the top post-baccalaureate academy in the field.

Darkwick Academy’s rigorous academic structure aims to produce elites capable of serving both national and global roles. Those who attend and graduate are known for their exceptional prestige and expertise.

Darkwick Academy serves as the flagship to its smaller sister branches. Its purpose and mission, like the others, is to nurture extraordinary talents to protect the world from the threat of anomalies—setting the standard for subjugation rather than destruction.
</span>

<span class="canon">
Unique to Darkwick Academy is the presence of “special admission students,” classified as **ghouls**—individuals who possess extraordinary powers as a result of demon contracting. While ghouls are confirmed to exist at other branches, such as <a href="#branches:emrys"><span class="canon">Emrys Academy</span></a> in the UK, it is expected that all ghouls eventually transfer to Darkwick Academy to further hone their abilities.

According to student policies, each student must carry a photo ID (name, house, year) at all times. Students cannot leave campus without permission; while there is slight leniency for new students, leaving campus requires either an R&amp;R permit (for leisure, approved by House leadership) or an official investigation order. Curfews typically apply to leisure time, but not to investigations.

There are bus stops designated for study camps only.
