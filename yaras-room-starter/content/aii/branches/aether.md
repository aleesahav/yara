Aether Academy serves as the **United States Branch** of the Anomalous Investigation Institute and is divided into **four regional divisions**, each operating as an independent campus with a specialized focus.

## Regional Divisions

- **Aether North — The Pylon**  
  New York • Beneath Liberty Island

- **Aether West — The Atelier**  
  San Francisco • Beneath Angel Island

- **Aether East — The Nexus**  
  Washington D.C. • Pentagon Deep Core

- **Aether South — The Sanctum**  
  New Orleans • Underground Catacombs

While the branch is divided regionally, **all campuses share a unified core curriculum**. Students receive instruction in anomalous theory, containment, investigation, subjugation, and tactical application. Regardless of post-graduation specialization, all students must demonstrate proficiency in field logic, artifact familiarity, and baseline combat conditioning.

Each campus maintains fortified containment wings for subjugated anomalies used in ongoing research. In addition, every division houses a **sanctuary for benevolent anomalies**, unique to the U.S. branch’s approach.

## Structure and Leadership

Unique to the U.S. branch, each division specializes in its own academic and operational focus within the broader Institute. Due to the scale and separation of the campuses, **Aether Academy does not employ a House system**.

Instead, each Division operates under a unified leadership structure:

- **Captain** — Administrative authority and public face of the Division; exemplifies leadership, discipline, and operational mastery.
- **Vice Captain** — Oversees operations, mission and squad assignments, security, and internal logistics.
- **Strategist** — Responsible for vision, tactics, mission dossiers, intelligence gathering, and Division protocols.
- **Liaison** — Handles inter-Division communication, cross-Branch coordination, and in some cases public or international affairs.
- **Mentors** — Train members and lead specialized sub-groups within mission squads.
- **Members** — The general student and operative body of each campus.

Though geographically and academically distinct, this structure ensures every Division operates with clarity, shared responsibility, and alignment within the larger Institute framework.

## Admissions — Three Phases

### Practical Trial
The first phase evaluates heightened perception and analytical instinct. Candidates must uncover hidden environmental clues—requiring an understanding of anomalous logic—to activate a portal leading to a simulated anomaly encounter. There, they must **contain or eliminate the threat** using limited resources and strategic thinking.

Containment results in **full acceptance**, aligning with the Institute’s preference for preservation and control. Elimination is still considered a pass, but candidates enter on **probationary status** during their first semester.

### Written Examination
The second phase tests academic rigor through a comprehensive written exam covering anomalous theory, historical case studies, and contemporary research.

### Resonance Trial (U.S. Branch)
Unique to the United States branch, the third phase measures **innate anomalous affinity** rather than knowledge. Each candidate undergoes four immersive simulations, each corresponding to a Division:

- **Nexus** — Tactical breach under combat stress  
- **Atelier** — Artifact failure and reengineering under temporal instability  
- **Sanctum** — Spiritual contagion within a living host  
- **Pylon** — Negotiation with an unstable anomalous or divine entity  

No guidance is provided. Instructors observe instinct, morality, and resonance under pressure.

After admission, students complete a comprehensive personality assessment to determine alignment with a specific Division.

## Division Notes

### The Pylon (North)
*Liberty Island • New York*  
**Specialty:** Ethics, Diplomacy, and Relations

Bureaucratic, cautious, and meticulous, Aether North operates within the hidden hollow of the Statue of Liberty. While administrative outposts extend beneath Ellis Island, its symbolic core remains tied to the nation’s most storied monument.

As the Institute’s public-facing authority, The Pylon manages policy enforcement, ethical oversight, and international communication. It interprets global anomalous law, balancing precedent with diplomacy.

Trained roles include anomalous lawyers, historians, bioethicists, journalists, civilian liaisons, and inter-Branch negotiators. This Division is not combat-oriented; instead, it is the diplomatic nerve center where language, legality, and narrative serve as weapons.

---

### The Atelier (West)
*Angel Island • San Francisco*  
**Specialty:** Artifact Engineering and Alchemy

Shrouded by coastal mist beneath Angel Island’s ruins, Aether West is the Institute’s foremost campus for artifact research, alchemic science, restoration, and creation.

Students study artifact functionality, potionology, transmutation, material manipulation, and hybrid artifact-alchemy engineering. Researchers examine anomalous byproducts, residues, and creature remains to distill components for artifacts and potions.

Graduates often pursue careers as artifact researchers, inventors, containment architects, alchemic theorists, or anomaly geneticists. Rumors persist of biotechnological-anomaly integration research, though this remains unconfirmed.

---

### The Nexus (East)
*Pentagon Deep Core • Washington D.C.*  
**Specialty:** Political Power, Military Strategy, and Anomalous Crime

Buried beneath the Pentagon’s restricted sublevels, Aether East serves as the Institute’s black-budget stronghold. It trains militarized, tactical agents and houses the nation’s elite anomaly-trained Special Ops forces.

This Division specializes in high-risk containment operations, intelligence, and black-level missions. Graduates include combat tacticians, interrogators, containment commanders, and intelligence strategists.

It is rumored that weaponization of supernatural entities occurs here, though such research would be considered highly classified.

---

### The Sanctum (South)
*Underground Catacombs • New Orleans*  
**Specialty:** Medicine, Occult Research, and Spiritual Contamination

Built beneath a decommissioned hospital in the French Quarter, Aether South focuses on the intersection of life, death, and anomalous disease.

Home to **Aether General Hospital**, the Sanctum leads the nation in anomalous medicine, curse research, spiritual virology, and plague containment. Working closely with the Atelier, the campus advances potionology, immunology, and experimental treatments for anomalous afflictions.

Doctors, field medics, and spiritual specialists are trained here. Some patients never leave. It is rumored that anomalous creatures are stored post-mortem for sanctification, organ harvesting, or—under extreme circumstances—necromantic research.
