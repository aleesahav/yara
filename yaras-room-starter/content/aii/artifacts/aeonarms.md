The **Aeon Arms** are prosthetic limbs engineered collaboratively between <a href="#branches:aether">Aether Academy</a> (West Division) and Darkwick’s <a href="#departments:dagr">Department of Genetic Research</a>, based on earlier artifact prosthetic models.

The Aeon Arms are capable of **neural synchronization**, allowing for full range of motion, filtered tactile response, and pain feedback designed to prevent overuse or structural failure. The limbs adaptively grow with their user, provided they are regularly maintained and calibrated by a certified artifact specialist.

If left untuned, neural feedback inconsistencies may occur—resulting in seizures, phantom limb pain, or memory misfires  
(for example: crushing bone when one only meant to high-five).

Extended combat use may also cause exhaustion through energy drain or sudden blood sugar crashes.

The Aeon Arms currently belong to Luciana Du Verre.
