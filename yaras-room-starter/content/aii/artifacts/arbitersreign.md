**Arbiter’s Reign** is the personal artifact of <a href="#profiles:luciana">Luciana Yoon Du Verre</a>.

The artifact takes the form of lightweight brass knuckles capable of scaling in power based on a target’s **threat level or malevolence**. It is implied that the artifact can read a target’s spiritual, moral, and emotional resonance—whether anomaly *or* human.

When used against inanimate objects lacking spiritual presence, the artifact instead scales to the strength of the wielder.

Because of this, Arbiter’s Reign *can* be lethal. Debate persists over whether such killings are carried out by the wielder—or by the artifact itself, acting in response to the target’s spirit.

Luciana rarely uses the artifact. I suspect she avoids situations where she knows it could become fatal.
