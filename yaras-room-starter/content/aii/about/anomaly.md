There are things in this world that defy the rules society has deemed “normal.”  
We often classify these things as *the occult*, *the arcane*, *paranormal phenomena*, or *cryptids*.  
In addition, ghouls, their demonic pacts, possessions, and curses are also classified as anomalies.

Sometimes anomalies are used for human gain, as I’ve learned. That is to say, some are good, some are bad, some just exist. But one thing is for sure — anomalies that provide great power instantly come with a great cost.  
I figure this is why the AII wants to contain them and study them, rather than simply eliminate them.

<span class="canon">
Within the AII, anomalies are classified by a **Class system**, highlighting how powerful they are  
(Class A being the strongest).  
Anomalies can change rank at any time as new data is observed.

*Before I knew all of this, I sure was okay with eliminating them…*
