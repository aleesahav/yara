<span class="canon">Each branch of the AII (including Noire) maintains a Special Operations & Containment Cleanup Unit (commonly shortened to Special Ops), tasked with post-anomaly incident control and civilian mitigation.

For example, at Darkwick (Japan Branch,) when an anomaly manifests, ghouls are dispatched first to subjugate any anomalous entity. It is then that Special Ops follows immediately after, handling all non-anomalous fallout: evacuating civilians, sealing locations, administering memory suppressants, falsifying official reports, and ensuring no trace of anomalous activity reaches the public record. Their work is clinical, quiet, and intentionally invisible—most civilians never realize they were involved in an incident at all.</span>

At other branches, since ghouls are not common anomalies outside of Japan's branch, it's specially trained field operatives that handle anomaly containment, and special operations that handle any fallout with the public sector. 

Notably, Aether Academy, collaborates closely with all division's Special Operations, by working with West Division's alchemists and artifact specialists for suppression agents and cleanup artifacts.
