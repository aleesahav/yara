Each branch of the AII (with the exception of Noir Academy) maintains a **Department of Anomalous Biology**, dedicated to the academic study and instruction of anomaly biology.

While biology is a broad discipline, this department’s scope is primarily **theoretical and observational**. Its core function is to understand how anomalous organisms come into existence, how they function, and how they survive.

Areas of focus include—but are not limited to—anomaly anatomy, ecology, and behavior. The department is also responsible for biological classification and for determining how anomalies fit (or fail to fit) within the natural world.
