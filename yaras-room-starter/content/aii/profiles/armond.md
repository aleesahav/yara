Armond Du Verre is the first son of patriarch <a href="#profiles:gaultier">Gaultier Du Verre</a>, the elder brother of <a href="#profiles:brice">Brice Du Verre</a>, husband to <a href="#profiles:soojin">Soojin Yoon</a>, and father to <a href="#profiles:luciana">Luciana Yoon Du Verre</a>.

A French nobleman, Armond is the current President of <a href="#branches:sidereal">Sidereal Academy</a>, a position passed to him upon Gaultier’s death ten years ago. In contrast to his father, Armond’s leadership style is often described as *elegant* and *mystic*—whatever that’s supposed to mean.

There are rumors that he intends to groom Luciana as his successor. Luciana scoffed at the idea once, saying:

> “The bastard only wants to use me as a figurehead because Gaultier ruined the all-woman line of Presidents when he took over. Pass.”

I haven’t met Armond personally, and Brice rarely speaks about him. Everything I’ve managed to dig up about him hasn’t been particularly compelling.
