Brice Du Verre is the second son of patriarch <a href="#profiles:gaultier">Gaultier Du Verre</a>, the younger brother of <a href="#profiles:armond">Armond Du Verre</a>, and the husband of <a href="#profiles:pia">Pia Santana</a>.

He is widely rumored to be the “prodigal” son—abandoning both his family and his status as a French nobleman to relocate to the United States with his share of Gaultier’s fortune when his father fell ill. Upon arriving in the West, he constructed a private mansion in the Marin Headlands and accepted a position within Aether Academy as the Director of Special Operations, overseeing 

Brice claimed he left because he knew he “wasn’t going to be enough” for Gaultier. Classic second-son syndrome.

Not long after, he met Pia Santana—an ordinary woman—and married her. Wanting to shield her from the anomalous world, Brice stepped back from direct Institute involvement and now works only as a consultant to Aether Academy when artifacts fall outside standard protocols. High-risk artifacts are almost always redirected to Darkwick Academy instead.

He is my adoptive father.
