**Born:** September 22, 1994  
**AII Alias:** “Sun”  
**Current Role:** Professor of Anomalous Combat, Aether West

Luciana Yoon Du Verre is the only daughter of <a href="#profiles:armond">Armond Du Verre</a>, President of the French AII branch, <a href="#branches:sidereal">Sidereal Academy</a>. That makes her my adopted cousin. 

She is known to the family as "Luce." 

Everything I know about Luciana comes either from her own careful words or from letters I snooped on at the Du Verre mansion. She’s a deeply private person—every sentence measured, every silence deliberate.

She was homeschooled by her mother, <a href="#profiles:soojin">Soojin</a>, from a young age and raised between France and Japan. When she was eight years old, she became critically ill, resulting in the loss of both arms. Because her illness occurred in Japan, she remained there even after the acute phase passed, undergoing long-term rehabilitation and integration with specialized bilateral artifact prosthetics.

Due to spending much of her childhood in clinical environments, her education remained private. Despite this, she excelled academically and was accepted into Sidereal Academy at eighteen—despite it being a post-baccalaureate institution.

I learned most of this through letters she sent to <a href="#profiles:brice">Brice</a>, her uncle—my adoptive father—whom she seemed particularly close to. It’s also why I suspect she accepted a faculty position at Aether Academy, and why she chose to move into his home.

Luciana doesn’t like talking about herself. She *does*, however, ask an alarming number of questions—strategic ones, like she’s testing you. I never had a reason to lie to her… except once, about snooping around the Du Verre mansion. She asked again afterward, clearly expecting the truth.

So I gave it to her.  
I haven’t lied to her since.

### Notes

- Her bilateral prosthetic arms are called <a href="#artifacts:aeonarms"><u>Aeon Arms</u></a>.
- In addition, she possesses a secondary artifact known as <a href="#artifacts:arbitersreign">Arbiter’s Reign</a>. I’ve never seen her use it.
- She exhibits unexplained superhuman strength. I confirmed this once by hiding in shadow to observe her—she lifted the Erard piano in Brice's mansion with one arm while retrieving papers that slid underneath it.
- Despite this, she demonstrates extreme control over her strength. If anything, she’s holding herself back.
- Because of her relentless questioning, I sometimes suspect she can detect lies.
- Her abilities make me suspect she may be a ghoul, but she would never admit it—especially given how we parted when I was transferred from Aether. She only reveals herself to people unlikely to question what they’re seeing.
