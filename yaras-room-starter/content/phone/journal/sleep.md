I’ve been tossing and turning all night. It’s been like this for the last week I’ve been here. Sleep never did come easy to me, but here, I feel this weight on my chest every time I lie down. And even the slightest bit of silence I get is filled with the loudest Whispering I’ve ever heard.

Before, it used to feel like it was only one voice. But ever since that damn encounter with the Heart Stealer—and since I’ve been carrying this… this blade in my chest, the blade I’ve called *Maiden’s Grief*—it feels like there’s another voice. One, maybe two. Either way, I haven’t gotten a good night’s rest in days.

I’m going to have to seriously concoct a brew that’ll knock my ass out.

Shit… if only I could find a way to get access to that lab on the second floor. It’s locked, but when I shadow-walked in there, it was totally abandoned—like someone left suddenly, like things were taken in a rush and never cleaned up properly…
