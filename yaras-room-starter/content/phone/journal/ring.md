Her name is Chisaya Mitsuko. Or, I guess—since I’m in Japan—surname first, then given name. Yeah. Mitsuko Chisaya. She’s cursed by an anomaly. Taken here for answers, for a cure, or to be studied by Darkwick, but that’s a whole ’nother theory I have.

Anyway, I had just been coming back from Dante’s office, dropping off paperwork that Tohma made me run because he was too busy doing something for the Welcoming Party tonight in Frostheim—but I’m kinda glad he sent me instead. I was just about to walk down the stairs when Mitsuko, that Fuji Kaito second-year kid in Frostheim, and a transfer student called Lucas Errant were huddled downstairs.

The girl was wearing a veil, and when Errant lifted it to reveal her face, it suddenly jumped off her and turned into a ring. She said she had found it and put it on to hide her face because she’d apparently been the civilian they brought onto campus after being cursed by an anomaly earlier today—the one with her picture on Wanted Signs posted on every corner. She couldn’t take off the veil, but since it had turned into a ring on her finger, the ring couldn’t come off.

Then Romi stumbles in suddenly, points his fucking sniper at Fuji, and shoots—but Errant takes Mitsuko’s hand and shouts *“Iggnam,”* an incantation of sorts. After that, it unleashes this insane protective barrier around the three of them, and all three look up in panic, like they’d seen something massive and shocking up there that I couldn’t see.

Mitsuko lets go of Errant, and all he can say is, *“What did you just do?”* Fear in his eyes—like he shocked himself that his Stigma produced something that powerful. I was confused about why he’d react like that, but then the Chancellor kid intervened at that exact moment, stopped the commotion, and took Mitsuko away.

I couldn’t help using my artifact to phase into the shadows in Cornelius’s office to snoop on that conversation. After lecturing the girl for trying to run, he asks Mitsuko for the ring back—but she can’t take it off. They take her to an examination room to check for the presence of a Stigma, but since they had Kusanagi Haku as the examiner, I didn’t follow. Astute bastard that he is, I figured he’d notice the shadows shifting and expose me, so I stayed out.

I waited until Mitsuko was escorted back to Cornelius’s office, and—long story short—he said the girl possessed the Sage’s Ring. Supposedly a powerful artifact meant to enhance ghouls’ stigmas, meaning she’d be an incredible asset on missions. After explaining what ghouls were, how their stigmas made them valuable to the academy and the world beyond, and how she could help, they decided the ring *chose* her and offered her admission—and the role of Honor Student—to go on missions with the ghouls to figure out how to break her curse.

Odd. Asking a civilian to suddenly be thrust into this dangerous world instead of offering her safety? I don’t get it. And that ring. That fucking ring—*“chose”* her, and suddenly they want to use her? I’m sensing some strange shit brewing. Sure, the Sage’s Ring—and touching the girl—might help me confirm something about myself that I’m still not convinced of, but… using her? To enhance power? On dangerous missions? All so *she* can figure out how to break the curse?

What kind of renowned research academy puts civs in that position anyway…?

Shit. I’m going to be late for the Weighing of Souls. Better come back to this some other time.
