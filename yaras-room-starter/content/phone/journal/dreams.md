I wonder if I’m making the Fog potions too strong these days. I’ve always used my Fog potions just to get to sleep faster—as a natural supplement—but since coming to Darkwick and not being able to find sleep easily, I’ve tweaked the recipe to be a bit stronger. And so, the Fog-induced dreams… well, the dreams that come to me are… unsettling.

In these particular Fog-induced dreams, it’s like I’m lucid dreaming, but I’m not myself. I feel real, and I feel like I’m *there*, but I can’t control my actions. It’s like I’m someone else. Something else.

These dreams only come when I take a Fog potion, usually on nights when I have to go on missions.

You see, Darkwick requires me to go on anomaly subjugation missions, which is vastly different from when I was at Aether. Aether focused on artifact and alchemy study, so low-grade subjugation missions were extracurricular and required a lot of clearance. And because it took too much work just to get out on the field, I only did it when I had the time. Shame—because they were easy. They were… fun… but they fueled my bloodlust. My vengeance for the Heart Stealer. I thought it was best to avoid it until I was actually ready to take on the Heart Stealer.

And when I did, I got my vengeance. I thought maybe I’d never have to fight anomalies again.

But no.

Here—now that I’m classified as a *ghoul* after I got my vengeance—I’m **required** to go on subjugation missions. And now I’ve learned that whenever I have to go into combat with anomalies, it’s just like before. Fighting fuels my bloodlust. My whole body vibrates with this… intensity. The Whispering gets louder. My chest tightens up. I swear I can hear a faint cry in my ears, but the Whispering sometimes tries to drown it out.

That first time it happened, it didn’t fade with time. I thought I’d sleep it off, but I just lay there—tossing and turning—tormented by the faint crying and the loudness of the Whispering.

So maybe it’s not the Fog potion. Maybe it’s the missions. Maybe it’s the bloodlust.

And the dreams…

All the dreams start underwater, just below the surface of the ocean. I’m not drowning or anything—just floating there, waiting, watching the moon beyond the sea’s surface shine the fullest and brightest. When it reaches its full face, that’s when I’m able to move.

When I swim to the surface, my vision tunnels, like I’m searching for a specific thing and *only* that thing. Cold night air rushes against my cold skin as I emerge from the water and walk onto the shore. I don’t feel the sand beneath my feet, but I know I’m trudging through it, dragging myself forward.

I try to look down at my hands, but I keep moving—until I leave the beach and end up on some unfamiliar street. I’m anxious about something. I’m searching for something. I *need* it, like my whole existence revolves around that purpose alone.

But I never stay asleep long enough to find what I’m looking for. I always wake up right before a door—one I *know* leads to what I need.

I’ve had this dream a few times now. It’s different from regular dreams, you know? And when I dream that I’m this thing—whatever I become in the dream—I just *know* it’s one of those dreams again. I’m always the same thing, but it’s always a different beach. A different street. A different town. A different door.

But it’s always under a full moon. I’m always waking up in the ocean, leaving the water when the moon is at its brightest. And I always feel like I’m walking like a ghost—not wandering, but searching for that *something*.

Sometimes… I want to stay asleep longer. To figure out what’s happening.

But I’m terrified that whatever I find—whatever I’m looking for—will change me in the real world.
