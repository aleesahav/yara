Aether Academy did not have curriculum that covered demons and demonology in depth. In fact, it was almost taboo—the way that if anyone at the academy brought it up, they would desperately change the topic, and they didn’t care how obvious they were in doing so. They said “that was Darkwick’s expertise” and hoped that squashed the subject entirely.

Of course, anyone familiar with the anomalous world already knew what demons were. By definition alone, demons are supposedly malevolent supernatural entities that, in many beliefs, are conductors of different kinds of evils. According to the Ars Goetia grimoire, some even grant powers to ordinary men.

Those humans who survive the pact-making are called <a href="#combat:ghouls">ghouls</a>.

To me, it’s not clear what those ghouls are giving up in return.

*I have this feeling that everyone here knows more than they’re letting on, of course.*
