Cornelius chose not to administer one during my admission.

He reviewed my transfer paperwork and said:  
“Oh. It looks like you’ve already completed a stigma test with Professor Olivier as your proctor. Since hers couldn’t identify your stigma—only its presence—ours would do the same.”

Which means the paperwork was altered.

*Why would she do that?*  
*And what else is missing from my file?*
