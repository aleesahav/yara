During my admission meeting on the day of my arrival, the Chancellor wanted to make sure I knew enough about demon pacts. He and Hyde questioned me, asking if I <span class="canon">made a desperate wish to become a ghoul.</span> The question alone intrigued me, because my so-called “contracting” very much could have come about from a desperate wish, but who could say? *I always held a desperate wish in the back of my mind…*

<span class="canon">
Anyway, Hyde noted that a human makes a desperate, often unconscious or emotionally charged wish. This wish is typically made in a moment of extreme emotional vulnerability, trauma, or existential crisis. Then, that is when the demon responds—likely due to some kind of… resonance with the wish.
</span>

<span class="canon">
The pact itself is another process. While the demon grants the wish, the human must survive a trial—said to require that they “devour the demon.” Failure results in either a gruesome death or survival as a soulless husk, where the demon consumes the human soul instead.
</span>

<span class="canon">
If they survive this process, the human becomes what’s known as a <a href="#combat:ghouls">ghoul</a>: someone who has successfully devoured and/or bound the demon. In doing so, they gain a <a href="#combat:stigma">stigma</a>—a supernatural ability tied to the demon’s nature. According to the Chancellor, they’re considered one-in-a-million exceptions.
</span>

To me, it’s unclear whether the demon lives inside them, whether it’s defeated entirely, or whether multiple contracts are possible…

Which causes me to write all my lingering questions:

- Can demon pacts be broken?
- Are ghouls hosts, or do they destroy the demon?
- Why *these* humans? Why *these* demons?
- The wish itself doesn’t seem tied to the stigma obtained.
- Is long-term spiritual damage inevitable?
- **And most importantly—do I actually have a demon contract?**  
  *Because some of this makes sense… but it doesn’t feel right that I don’t know the name of my demon or my stigma.*

<span class="canon">
Don’t get me wrong—I might believe Hyde and Cornelius. Might. But I overheard Kurosagi Leo telling Haizono Sho that he wanted to know what the other “pact makers wished for.” If that’s coming from a ghoul himself, then the wish part must be real.
</span>

Which makes me think I should probably be studying ghouls themselves.

Not that I care to be social, but the Obscuary bar proved worthwhile. Mizuki Rui casually mentioned cleaning up after a 400-year-old vampire who lived in the House. That alone made me think he might know more than he let on.

When I tried to shadow-snoop Edward, he clocked my artifact instantly—burned my cover away with his phone’s flashlight and asked why I thought I could fool an old man with older tricks. I traded blood for answers.

<span class="canon">
Edward confirmed what Hyde and the Chancellor said—but was clear on one thing: demons do not respond to deliberate summoning. Ritual circles and black-magic summons only produce lesser spirits and unreliable results.
