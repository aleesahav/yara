Ghouls are humans who survive demonic pacts by devouring their demon after their desperate wish is granted. Once transformed, they are classified as anomalies.

Through contracting, ghouls gain enhanced physical durability and a supernatural ability known as a <a href="#combat:stigma">stigma</a>.

Darkwick maintains a special admissions program for ghouls. Their numbers have reportedly spiked in recent years.

<span class="canon">
In Japan, ghouls are the primary combatants responsible for engaging and capturing anomalies due to their superior capabilities.

This differs from Aether Academy, which uses highly specialized field operatives instead. *It never occurred to me whether they’re ghouls themselves… perhaps that’s their best-kept secret. Or perhaps I only question my old branch now because I didn’t know ghouls existed until I was labeled one.*

While most ghouls fall under Darkwick’s jurisdiction, some exist outside it—such as Lucas Errant, who transferred from Emrys Academy. He was the only ghoul there and reportedly faced no restrictions.

In my case, Aether Academy decided I should be sent to Japan for “further observation.”  
Opportunity, they called it.

*I don’t know if I’m a ghoul. That’s why I’m studying them—to see whether I agree with Aether’s conclusion.*
