This man is pure trouble behind a mask of sincerity. I know it because he feels familiar. Familiar in the way that he and I might be the same—except I don’t hide behind a glass monocle and buttoned up blazer.

Sure, he’s playing dutiful right hand to the Captain, but he doesn’t seem to give the rich-kid vibe like these elitists. I hear from these loud gossips that Kamurai put in a special request sometime last school year for Ishibashi to be his right hand. There was even talk that Kamurai betrayed someone he was close to to do that. What’s so special about this guy?

Maybe considering that he’s been working twice as hard as a normal person getting his hands dirty… maybe he’s got some promise to glory.

And, let me tell you, he’s not ashamed to show off his dirty gloves. It’s more like he wears them with pride but pretends not to.

I want to ruin that mask. I want to find out what’s underneath it.
