<strong>September 9, 2024:</strong> These last few days have been… a whirlwind. It wasn’t even a mission I signed up for, but somehow I was so deeply intertwined with. And I learned more about Jin in these last few days than I have in the two months that I’ve been here—and it’s not even because I snooped, but because I watched him do what he apparently does best.

Lead.

Jin’s stigma is broken. But the Honor Student brought back his power. He has the stigma to command anyone or anything at will. When he gave that command to the numerous No-Face anomalies on top of that building, I felt my heart jolt in my chest and the Whispering screech in my ear, as if it too wanted to obey the command.

How? Why?

What demon bestowed that kind of power to him? And why did he lose it?

Could it have to do with his dead mom? Or perhaps the strained relationship with his father? They say that the mental state of a person has a profound effect over their stigma—as Jin used to be able to use his without an incantation, but now he can’t use it at all.

Could whatever happened during the Clash—or after the Clash—have affected his mind so much that it physically renders him incapable of using it without the Sage’s Ring?

… I wonder…
