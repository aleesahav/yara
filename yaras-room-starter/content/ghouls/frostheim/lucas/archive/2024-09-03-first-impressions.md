Met him in the main castle on my way back from registering for classes. He said he had just arrived from the Britain branch Emrys, and was looking for the Chancellor’s office.

When I transferred, I was told that transfers to Darkwick were rare, but here he was. I couldn’t help but let my curiosity get to me, so I hid in the shadows to follow him to his meeting with Cornelius, and found out that at Emrys, he was the only ghoul there, and they let him roam free.

So he wasn’t forced to transfer, like I was, because he was a ghoul… He <i>did</i> say he was always getting his peers into trouble by being a ghoul, but… I wonder why he really transferred.
