Ren’s your average First year at Darkwick who got into the that whitney, hedonistic, slacker type. But I can’t blame him. He lives a lifestyle that’s all too familiar to me. I’m a little bit jealous to see that he can be that way..

I run into him at the school shop constantly when I’m trying to re-up on the cheapest mealtime replacements, and he’s often getting instant ramen, and muttering under his breath how much he hates being here.

He also works part-time at the Mystery diner, completely deadpan when serving or taking orders, and on his phone muttering about raids on a mobile game.

Other than that, when I catch a drink with Haru at the bar, he’s asked me advice on how to get Ren more sociable, telling me that he spends a lot of his time holed up in his room, watching B-Horror movies while clutching his big stuffed shark. I tried to tell Haru to just let the man be.

After all… I’d probably do the same if I could, especially if I never encountered the AII.

I wonder how someone so normal, so annoyed with this world, ended up a ghoul and forced to be at Darkwick? Could Ren and I have something in common that I should keep tabs on?
