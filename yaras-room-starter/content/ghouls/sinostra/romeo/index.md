**September 10, 2024:** On nights I’ve spent with him and Haru at Rui’s bar, Romi’s dished out a few drunken ramblings at me, revealing a little too much that he’d probably never otherwise tell me, since of course he only seems me as a “CWT” (Cheap Wasted Tryhard).

Firstly, the leg he walks on is a prosthetic. I’m sure of it. Okay. I mean, he hasn’t said that outright, but he always talks about how he needs a tune up before he throws off the alignment in his back. Or how after a long day of being on his feet all day, he’d like to just take it all off and relax in the bath. Or how, he just doesn’t have the body like he used to. Cold also gets to him, how it really gets his body to ache more than the next person. I believe it, too. The other day, on the day of the Weighing Ceremony, he pretty much chased Fuji around campus over his gambling debt, not really running, but still complained of being worn out.

The other thing he complains about is his crumbled Italian fashion dynasty that he was once so enmeshed with. He talks about Italy like it was once a lover that he’s lost and misses terribly, but refuses to give into…

And lastly, he complains about how that Captain of his is never picking up his slack, how Taiga never truly understands that he might be waste deep in a problem that he can’t solve alone.

I feel kind of bad for him; he seems like he’s got his hands dirty for someone who wants to maybe try to keep them smooth and clean with expensive hand cream or something.
