He’s quite a pretty boy with a bratty mouth, always popping bubblegum and acting cute. Everytime he speaks, I can’t help but laugh. I can’t tell if its it’s because he’s charming or full of shit. After all, half his lines are trash, but I can’t hate him.

Sure, he’s like, your run of the mill e-boy twink influencer with a shameless ego—but goddamn, is he smart. Sure, he’s always on his phone and always got his earphones at his neck, but I can tell, he’s the type of snake that tries to find out every rumor that exists so he can use against you later. Like, for one, he’s obsessed with trying to find out what every one of the ghouls wished for in exchange for their soul.

That said, you can tell he’s listening more than he’s speaking, which is interesting for a guy that never shuts the fuck up. He’ll be useful to have in my court, maybe…
