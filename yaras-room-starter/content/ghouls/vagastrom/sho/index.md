<b>September 12, 2024:</b> Okay. So he opened his food truck. I’ve been stoping by every day this week. Because the food’s good, yeah? And of course, I can’t stay away.

Somehow, I managed to find out that he rides an anomalous bike he calls “Bonnie,” plays every sport to man, plays the guitar or something like that, fights like a damn warrior, named #1 in the Pits already…

But. Hey. I’m just finding this all out as I go. You know. It’s not like I’m meaning to learn this about him. Committing it to memory. Writing it down, memorizing it or anything… Yeah. Anyway. Yeah.
