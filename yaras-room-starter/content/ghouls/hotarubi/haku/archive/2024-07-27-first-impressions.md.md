One of the first ghouls I’ve met. When I first got here, the Chancellor couldn’t find available Frostheim leadership to direct me to the grounds (shocker! Looking back..), so they called in Kusanagi. He didn’t even seem to mind, though. It was like he was used to that sort of thing, doing Darkwick favors.

He was yammering on about himself though. Seemed too comfortable, too charming, around someone he barely knew. In that short walk, he managed to tell me he’s the heir to a line of mediums and that his family owns a shrine.

He’s sharp, though, that’s for sure, and I don’t know if it’s his ability to detect spiritual energy, but I can tell when he’s looking at me, he’s going deeper than meets the eye. I should be careful around him. Chances are, he might have already tried probing into my soul.
