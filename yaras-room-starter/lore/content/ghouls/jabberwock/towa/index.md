I don’t know much about him, yet. He’s a bit odd and has strange eyes, that of a deer's or a goat’s. He doesn’t seem to speak during the day, just hums pretty songs. Whenever I get close to him, he always leans reaaaal close into my face and smiles wide. 

Then, at night, he wanders off to this odd glowing tree and treats it like kin. He eats plants and talks about love stories. He's someone that just seems to love, love. Or wants to love. Love like humans do.

Because truth be told, in all my days studying anomalies, something in my gut tells me that he might be something like that. He feels like something trying to be human.
