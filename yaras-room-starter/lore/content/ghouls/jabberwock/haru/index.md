<b>September 1, 2024</b>: I was not joking when I said Haru treats the Safari like a tourist attraction, tickets to the Jabberwock Safari Park are 5800 yen! Wild. Yeesh.

Anyway, Haru said I could get in for free if I volunteered, so I volunteered over the weekend for the hell of it, and boy did he work me ragged. I couldn’t actually go near the anomalies (perhaps given that he’s a Captain, he might have peeked at my record of not… well, being nice to anomalies in the past…), and he just had me cleaning up the common spaces.

Even then, just watching him from afar, he works himself to the bone. Constantly drinking energy drinks, not stopping for rest. He just seems like he’s got something he’s trying to pay back, and hides it under this crazy obsessed work ethic. Day in, day out, no sleep, rest is for the wicked kind of feel.

And that Peekaboo! Are these creatures really docile enough for a Safari? His kid alone got some mean teeth. He bit me, and apparently, Haru says he does this to those he doesn’t like… Which is, well, everyone but Haru, apparently… That thing must know I have a bad history with Anomalies…
