I met Haru (along with Romi) at Rui's bar one evening in the summer.

He’s cute. Got this country's cadence and fun way of speaking, which I’ve been told is Kansai. And he’s got a “single dad” thing going for him, as in, he carries a little anomalous creature around like a baby. It’s a Peekaboo and calls it his child.

He got so drunk one night, that he told me his arm is prosthetic and said I could cop a feel. It was almost like Natalia’s, but the engineering was different. Every bioprosthetic artifact I hear are different for their different person, as its purposes and intents may be different. Man, I’d love to talk to the engineer that manages that piece.

Haru runs Jabberwock as its captain, and treats the Safari like a tourist attraction. He said I could call him if I ever wanted to volunteer to work with the anomalous creatures. I might take him up on his offer.
