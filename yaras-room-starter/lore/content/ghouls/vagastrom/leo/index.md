<b>September 13, 2024:</b> Of course, his stigma is the ability to extend his hearing range. And with the Honor Student’s help, it can break through even anomalous soundproofing. How useful might that be, right? Trying to hear what Mido and Ishibashi might be discussing in that car in the yard…

But despite his eavesdropping, snake-like behavior, he successfully completed Vagastrom’s first major mission, being the brain behind eliminating that strange ghost of the late streamer. He defined his spirit as a tulpa - the kind of anomaly that only manifests due to extreme negative emotion (mostly in context of a collective mind), rather than an actual malevolent spirit lingering behind past death. When he managed to livestream to his 600k followers or whatever, he managed to convince a large public mind that they had nothing to fear, which so erased the Tulpa’s existence. Or so I understand.

I have to give credit where credit is due. Sure, he pulled the ultimate millennial mode of attack - using the internet - to save the day. After this, Mido named him Vice Captain.
