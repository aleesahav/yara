Everyone says he killed someone, and I guess I can believe it. His stigma has something to do with super strength. Besides that, he’s deadly quiet and I’m not sure if it’s because he’s not good with words or because he’s just made of stone.

I can’t deny it though, despite being inept in social cues and technology, he’s got serious leader vibes, which makes for a good Captain, I suppose.

Rumor says his real name isn’t Mido…
