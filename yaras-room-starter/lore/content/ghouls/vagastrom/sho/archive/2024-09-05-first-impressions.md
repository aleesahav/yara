Listen, I don’t like people when I first meet them, it’s just a rule of mine. But this one… Well, let me just tell you.

This morning, I was on my way to the main hall to drop some shit off for the House and two Red Vests were a few steps behind me, cat calling me, saying something about how there’s no way an ass like that was sorted into a prude’s House. Whatever.

Then, when I didn’t respond, they said even louder, Hey, bitch, we complimented you. Which of course, still ignored… Until one tried throwing a punch. Of course, it didn’t land. Grabbed him, pinned him down. The other one, playing dirty, threw his fist, too. I could have totally taken him too, but this loud mouth, cocky ass brat saw me as some damsel in distress and felt the need to get the other guy.

I was ready to fight him, too, but when I looked up… Well.

I guess he was charming enough with that stupid smile as he flipped the other guy to the ground, like he was thrilled. Fuck. That just got me…

When the Red Vests fucked off, the kid told me his name. Told me he’s going to open up a food truck on campus.

I reluctantly asked how I could pay him back for saving a poor fucking wench like me. He laughed. He just told me to be a taste tester before the truck opens up. Free of charge. Free food? Fuck yeah.
