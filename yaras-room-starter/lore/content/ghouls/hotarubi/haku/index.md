**August 24, 2024**: Haku’s been seen on campus filming that floating Biwa. It was odd to me, though, that maybe the anomaly wasn’t the Biwa, but something holding the Biwa. A ghost, perhaps? I couldn’t help but approach him about it. He just brushed it off with a smile and called me astute, then dropped an obvious foul distracting pick up line, (“You want me to film you, sometime?”) Yuck.

I was about to say something, but Ishibashi happened to be walking by at that moment, and gave his signature contrived chuckle, telling Kusanagi that his flirts never boded well for girls with “eyebrows always furrowed” like mine. Needless to say, my anger was redirected to that other snake, thinking that I needed his intervention.

Word gets around fast, though. Later that day, I was approached by some Frostheim girls, mocking me that Kusanagi “flirts with everyone like that,” and that I “shouldn’t feel special.” That didn’t intrigue me though — what intrigued me was that they said he’d “do that all the time when he was in Frostheim last year.” Ah, a lazy bag of bones in the ever disciplined Frostheim?

I looked into this, and apparently its correct. And, the year prior, he was in the now defunct Clementia the year before. I wonder if he’s the problem, or this place is… There’s talk about a traitor to the Ghouls in the grounds, and what perfect face of one who jumps ships every year.

It’s almost too obvious, though. He’s gotta be hiding something or using Darkwick for his own gain. Or perhaps they’re exploiting him, considering how he bends over backwards for the staff here…
