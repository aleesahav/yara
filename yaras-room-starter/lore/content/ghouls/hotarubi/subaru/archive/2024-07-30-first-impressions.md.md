The Captain of Hotarubi is one that appears gentle and polite. But I'm not sure I totally buy it. Word has it that he was a child kabuki actor but currently on hiatus for some notorious reason. Some part of me thinks he’s still… acting a part, despite him not in front of an audience. But, I suppose maybe Darkwick is an audience on its own.

*~~That doesn't make him special. They're all liars here...
