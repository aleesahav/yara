It's no secret by now that a good mystery compels me. After getting close enough to Kusanagi filming that floating Biwa he calls “Zenji Kotodama," online, I swear I could sense a profound energy that wasn’t just Kusanagi’s...

Piecing enough crumbs of clues together, I couldn't help but think that this floating biwa had to do with a rumor about a Hotarubi student that died during the Clash in April earlier this year. I thought, maybe it could be a ghost.

Back when I was a teenager, and the beginning of when I truly started to believe in a world unseen, Rune had always talked about how he could see ghosts. I never doubted their existence. I didn’t doubt it now when chasing after this energy.

Maybe I'll try chasing the energy and see what I can find out.
