**September 1, 2024:** This weekend, while I was volunteering at Jabberwock, I followed the Floating Biwa down to Jabberwock's aquatic caves. It... seemed to know I was following it, and stopped in front of a wall that had writing on it. As I approached, my eyes found the date "April 4th," and I suddenly felt a chill pass through me. It nearly made me stumble, and when I did, I tried to grab ahold of something to stop my fall, but I grabbed onto the floating Biwa by accident. 

It seemed to hold tight and break my fall. When I looked up, I found my gaze locked with red eyes that weren't quite there before. I opened my mouth to speak, then the form of a man seemed to solidify around those eyes after that.

"Are you..?" I asked, my breath stuttering. "A.. ghost?"
"You can see me!" He smiled wide, like he was relieved he could be perceived.
