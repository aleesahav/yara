Frostheim is the most influential Houses within the academy, rumored that it's members' families are sponsoring many different programs within the academy itself. It is indeed polished, powerful, undeniably cold, but full of elists that I'm not quite sure if I identify with, despite my last name. While it's been said that its students are known for their ambition and relentless pursuit of success, most of them hail from elite families that got them there in the first place. 

Sure, they're all self-assured, competitive, and acutely aware of their status, and they celebrate it through almost nightly parties held in the ground ballball room, wearing their "Sunday Best" and rubbing elbows while they laugh over fancy fingerfood... <!-- pagebreak -->


## Dormitory & Grounds

Frostheim’s dormitory resembles a grand, azure castle perpetually embraced by winter. In the grand entrance hall, an anomalous aurora lights up the room from the ceiling, endlessling dancing and glowing in patterns that seem to never seem to repeat. Each room is decorated and furnished with lavish interior. 

## Notable Locations

### Grand Ballroom

An extravagant hall used for high-society gatherings and formal celebrations. Frostheim seems to host celebratory balls after each major mission successes, but parties seem to happen so frequently that I don't seem to get what exactly they celebrate.

### The Darkwick Vaults

Located within Frostheim’s lower levels, it's a mystery what the vaults contain. I'm assuming the most valuable of the Academy's artifacts and secrets.<!-- pagebreak -->

Vice Captain Tohma Ishibashi spends most of his time here, using it as an office space. The temperature down there is even colder than the castle and surrounding grounds, but the furniture, sculpted from ice, are anomalously warm and more comfortable than expected.

The vault is guarded by anomalous glass chess pieces that can change size. Tohma commands them verbally; they attack when sensing malicious intent. They're quite interesting; they pursue intruders and assemble defensively when required, yet seem to show selective restraint. I have yet to go down there to try to slip into the vaults; those chessman can crush me if they know what a snoop I am. 

I've been down there once and refuse to go again for that very reason. 

### Captain’s Quarters

Captain Jin Kamurai’s room is located in the back of the castle on the top floor, obviously to ward off any visitors. To further amplify that, it's secured with anomalous soundproofing with no sound able to come in or out of the room. 

Whenever anyone visits him, he requires them to text Ishibashi or himself directly, and commands them to knock a certain amount of times (different each time) to verify it's truly them at the door.
