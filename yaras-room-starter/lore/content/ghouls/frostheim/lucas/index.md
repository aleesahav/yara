<strong>September 05, 2024:</strong> Lucas Errant was Weighed into Frostheim this evening. He might be of use to the house. His power, after all, is objectively useful.

Just before the Weighing of Souls this evening, Errant was seen running around with the Honor student and Frostheim student and ghoul Fuji Kaito in the main castle hall. Sinostra Ghoul, Romeo Lucci engaged Fuji in combat but in what felt like a split second decision, Errant, while having his stigma bolstered by holding contact with the Honor Student who held the artifact of the Sage’s Ring, shouted <i>Iggnam</i>, activating his stigma. The bullets that Romeo shot from his sniper stopped short of what appeared to be an invisible barrier protecting the three. Then, Errant and Fuji looked up behind them, and the sheer horror and awe in their expressions gave me the impression that they both saw something that I couldn’t. Perhaps it was the effect of his stigma being bolstered by the Sage’s Ring…

Anyway, it’s no surprise he’s in Frostheim, really. He’s got your typical rich-kid vibes, but… I give it to him. He’s not the same kind of snob as the lot of them.

He’s gentlemanly, white-gloved, helps-you-down-from-the-carriage kinda type. He’s always got a snack on him, too. But man is he a different person and lights up like a blazing fire when someone says “demon,” like he’s got a personal vendetta or something. Curious…
