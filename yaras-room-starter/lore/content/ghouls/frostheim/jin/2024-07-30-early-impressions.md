Everyone calls him the King of Frostheim, because he’s this great captain. Or once. I’ve even heard he was responsible for leading Frostheim to victory over the Laurel Crown his first year, and could have won last year if this Clash event didn’t happen.

Because of this Clash, rumor has it that something went wrong with him, though, but it’s all very secretive because he’s the President’s kid, and no one wants to get caught talking shit about someone so important.

He’s isolated now, and I don’t know if he’s even real.

I’ve been here about a week. I have yet to meet him, despite me being another ghoul sorted into his House.
