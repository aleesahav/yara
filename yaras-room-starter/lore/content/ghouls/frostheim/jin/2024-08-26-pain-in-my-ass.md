It’s only been about a month on campus before he finally showed himself to me—all while I was in that so-called “private” Onsen Tohma said I could use. Of course, the first day I use it, this arrogant bastard shows up and barks orders before I can even put clothes on.

I get what they mean by the rumors that he was some arrogant, tyrant of an asshole.

Every time he speaks—although rare—it’s always telling me what to do. Often times, things he refuses to do. Either he’s lazy or entitled, but either way, his personality makes me want to fucking strangle him.

Perhaps my thoughts of murder are so loud when I’m around him, that I actually forget about Whispering in my head.
