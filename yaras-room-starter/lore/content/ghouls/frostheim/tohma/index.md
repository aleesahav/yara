<strong>August 13, 2024:</strong> After I struck that girl silent for talking too much shit in my ear, Tohma called me into the Vaults to backhandedly praise me for stepping out of line and offered me a deal of “protection.” He asked me to do favors for him and the elusive Kamurai in exchange for quiet spaces.

I highly preferred to keep my head down and go undetected for the whole time here, but damn did access to a lab, a greenhouse, and a private onsen in the Woods really get me good…

Oh well. Small price to pay, hopefully, for brewing up a few salves here and there for him, or fetching tea from the campus store. What could possibly go wrong?

After all… having a private lab to do my work has given me enough time to transmute some of my Flies into snowflakes, and I’ve already snooped enough to find out that prior in Vagastrom. I knew he and I were similar.

Interesting, really, a man that’s prim and proper from a House full of rebels? Surely, there has to be a reason…
