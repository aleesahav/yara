Talk about a normal dude stuck among elitists. I don’t get rich kid vibes from him. He stands out like a sore thumb with some thrifted kicks and graceless swagger. But that’s not a bad thing. He’s relatable, I think. You can tell he’s not like them. You can tell by the way he carries himself—casual and self-made, almost.

Sure, he’s loud, annoying, girl-crazy… but I find him good company. He’s the only one I’ve felt like I can talk to without him undermining me. Perhaps it’s because he knows I’m not born from riches myself, despite my last name.

I think I’ll go thrifting with him sometimes.
