Everyone, including himself, says he doesn’t do missions. For a ghoul, I really thought we’re supposed to, but he’s managed to get away with it. Perhaps it’s because a lot of the other Frostheim snobs say it’s because he’s weak. Powerless.

But I get the sense he’s got more to him than meets the eye. After all, he wears this necklace with some insignia or crest that Romi is obsessed about, and I trust Romi’s judgement, since he can read value at a glance. Lucky thrift find or something more? Or is he playing ignorant?

I mean, the guy has some high running debt that Romi constantly chases him around about. Sure, we’re all a little money hungry, but what’s Fuji pinching pennies for that he’s got to go so far to gambling everything he’s got?
