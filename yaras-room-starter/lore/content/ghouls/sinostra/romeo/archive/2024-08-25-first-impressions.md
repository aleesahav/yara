<p>While at Rui’s bar, a loud mouth pretty boy walks in, speaking in acronyms every other fucking sentence and demands to be called “Fico.” He’s got the skin of a porcelain doll and eyes like amethyst jewels, cufflinks worth a grand a piece, and a work ethic that cuts you sharper than a blade, but methods of collection like a shady loanshark. If he wasn’t so goddamn nagging, he’d easily have me hypnotized. But something about him just makes me... laugh. Perhaps its the concoctions that Rui brews that gets me looser, so that I can relax around someone that would otherwise have me wound up…</p>
