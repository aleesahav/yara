<img class="portrait" src="assets/ghouls/Taiga_Hoshibami_Portrait.png" alt="Taiga Hoshibami portrait"> <p>The Captain of Sinostra is a pure enigma to me. I don’t even think I can wrap my brain around how to understand this one. He spends his days gambling in his casino without blinking an eye when he wins or loses, and he laughs when he’s shooting that tommy gun artifact. His stigma seems to predict some kind of future; I could be wrong. He just seems like he knows too much and (you would think) if you knew too much, you’d be trapped in your own head. Maybe that’s what it is. After all, he seems like his mind is miles away at all times. He commits nothing to memory. In fact, I’d win the gamble that if he’d knock my teeth out one day, and then ask me the next day if I was born without them. </p> <p>I’ve gone nose to nose with an anomaly that was ready to rip my heart out, and yet that thing doesnt terrify me as much as this one does. Why, you ask? I actually couldn’t tell you. I think when you meet someone that knows more about the unknown you do and still laughs like a psycho, you should fear them. It wasn’t even the mouth full of Like-Dove blood that scares me; it’s that look in his eyes that he knows your every weakness, your mortal enemies, and how you will die that does.</p> <div class="hr"></div> <p><a href="#sinostra:index">← Back to Sinostra</a> · <a href="#sinostra:taiga-gallery">Open Gallery</a></p>
