<p>Ritsu is the son of a well known and morally <s>corrupt</s> (err), questionable lawyer in Japan. When he was sorted into Sinostra, it surely made sense to everyone but him, as he was pining for a seat in Frostheim. Despite the utter shocker, he seems to be very devoted to the pursuit of status, by all means necessary, shady behavior included. I’ve caught him hanging in corridors with a listening ear and a recorder in hand, waiting for something worth knowing.</p> <p> I should give credit where credit is due, though. He’s very smart, having placed first in his cohort’s entrance exam. Not only can he quote Darkwick’s Rules and Policies like it’s on the back of his eyelids, and he seems to have the knack for ensuring he knows his shit before diving in on it. Not to mention, he’s a true professional like it’s no one’s business, clocking in and out on time like his life depends on it. </p> <p>If that’s not enough, he’s good with words and languages like German, Italian, French, and I even may have caught him reading Finnegans Wake, so he must know a great deal of English too,</p> <p>He’s the kind of guy I would have shoved into a locker because I was too jealous of his brain. If only I could be so focused.</p> <div class="hr"></div> <p><a href="#sinostra:index">← Back to Sinostra</a> · <a href="#sinostra:ritsu-gallery">Open Gallery</a></p>
