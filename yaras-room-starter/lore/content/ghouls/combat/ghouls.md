> Ghouls are humans who survive demonic pacts by devouring their demon after their desperate wish is granted. Once transformed, they are classified as anomalies.

> Through contracting, ghouls gain enhanced physical durability and a supernatural ability known as a [stigma](#combat:stigma).

> Darkwick maintains a special admissions program for ghouls. Their numbers have reportedly spiked in recent years.

> In Japan, ghouls are the primary combatants responsible for engaging and capturing anomalies due to their superior capabilities.

This differs from Aether Academy, which uses highly specialized field operatives instead. *It never occurred to me whether they’re ghouls themselves… perhaps that’s their best-kept secret. Or perhaps I only question my old branch now because I didn’t know ghouls existed until I was labeled one.*

> While most ghouls fall under Darkwick’s jurisdiction, some exist outside it—such as Lucas Errant, who transferred from Emrys Academy. He was the only ghoul there and reportedly faced no restrictions.<!-- pagebreak -->

In my case, Aether Academy sent me to Japan for punishment and further observation before my trial in a year.  

*I don't believe I'm a ghoul, so that’s why I’m studying them—to see whether I agree with Aether’s conclusion of what I became after I subjugated (?) the Atricordis.*
