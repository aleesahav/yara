During my admission meeting on the day of my arrival, the Chancellor wanted to make sure I knew enough about demon pacts. He and Hyde questioned me, asking if I > made a desperate wish to become a ghoul. The question alone intrigued me, because my so-called “contracting” very much could have come about from a desperate wish, but who could say? *I always held a desperate wish in the back of my mind…*

> Anyway, Hyde noted that a human makes a desperate, often unconscious or emotionally charged wish. This wish is typically made in a moment of extreme emotional vulnerability, trauma, or existential crisis. Then, that is when the demon responds—likely due to some kind of… resonance with the wish.

> The pact itself is another process. While the demon grants the wish, the human must survive a trial—said to require that they “devour the demon.” Failure results in either a gruesome death or survival as a soulless husk, where the demon consumes the human soul instead.

> If they survive this process, the human becomes what’s known as a [ghoul](#combat:ghouls): someone who has successfully devoured and/or bound the demon. In doing so, they gain a [stigma](#combat:stigma)—a supernatural ability tied to the demon’s nature. According to the Chancellor, they’re considered one-in-a-million exceptions.

To me, it’s unclear whether the demon lives inside them, whether it’s defeated entirely, or whether multiple contracts are possible…

Which causes me to write all my lingering questions:

- Can demon pacts be broken?
- Are ghouls hosts, or do they destroy the demon?
- Why *these* humans? Why *these* demons?
- The wish itself doesn’t seem tied to the stigma obtained.
- Is long-term spiritual damage inevitable?
- **And most importantly—do I actually have a demon contract?**

> Don’t get me wrong—I might believe Hyde and Cornelius. Might. But I overheard Kurosagi Leo telling Haizono Sho that he wanted to know what the other “pact makers wished for.” If that’s coming from a ghoul himself, then the wish part must be real.

Which makes me think I should probably be studying ghouls themselves. And so, I found myself socializing at the Obscuary bar. Mizuki Rui casually mentioned cleaning up after a 400-year-old vampire who lived in the House. That alone made me think he might know more than he let on.

When I tried to shadow-snoop Edward, he clocked my artifact instantly—burned my cover away with his phone’s flashlight and asked why I thought I could fool an old man with older tricks. I traded blood for answers.

> Edward confirmed what Hyde and the Chancellor said—but was clear on one thing: demons do not respond to deliberate summoning. Ritual circles and black-magic summons only produce lesser spirits and unreliable results.
