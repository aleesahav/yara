> Darkwick conducts stigma tests to confirm ghoul status and identify the presence of a stigma. The examinee is seated in a specialized chair that measures pulse, brainwaves, and other vitals while an examiner conducts the test.

> The specifics of the procedure are classified.

Cornelius chose not to administer one during my admission.

He reviewed my transfer paperwork and said:  
“Oh. It looks like you’ve already completed a stigma test with Professor Sun as your proctor. It would be unncessary to reconduct a stigma test here, I suppose, since ours, too, would only determine the **presence** of a stigma, and not the actualy power."

Hyde showed the briefest microtell of suspicion.

I kept mine internal. Because... ~~Luciana~~ **Professor Sun** never conducted such a test.

Which means the paperwork lies. *Why would she do that?*  *And what else is missing from my file?*
