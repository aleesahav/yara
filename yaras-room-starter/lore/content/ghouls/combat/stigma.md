> A stigma is a supernatural ability granted to someone who successfully devours a demon and becomes a ghoul.

> Each stigma is unique and, in most cases, invoked through an incantation—an anagram of the Ars Goetic demon’s name. Most ghouls must speak it aloud, though some can invoke it mentally.

> It was overheard that Kamurai Jin once did not require an incantation to activate his stigma. Hyde believes this correlates with either proficiency or mental state.

*I wonder if stigmas can manifest passively…*  
Sometimes I think that when Natalia asks a question, she already knows the answer. And when the answer is false, she knows that too.
