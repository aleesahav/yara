Aether Academy did not have curriculum that covered demons and demonology in depth. In fact, it was almost taboo—the way that if anyone at the academy brought it up, they would desperately change the topic, and they didn’t care how obvious they were in doing so. They said “that was Darkwick’s expertise” and hoped that squashed the subject entirely.

Of course, anyone familiar with the anomalous world already knew what demons were. By definition alone, demons are supposedly malevolent supernatural entities that, in many beliefs, are conductors of different kinds of evils. According to the Ars Goetia grimoire, some even grant powers to ordinary men.

> That being said, in Darkwick’s research, demons are the very entities with whom some humans are capable of creating a [pact](#combat:pact) in order to gain one wish and/or some kind of power, known as [stigma](#combat:stigma). Those humans who survive the pact-making are called [ghouls](#combat:ghouls).

To me, it’s not clear what those ghouls are giving up in return.

> According to the Chancellor, Cornelius: he states that “the true identity of demons is not known,” and that Darkwick’s funding research to ~~snakes~~ **researchers** like Hyde, who’s stated clearly that even to him, “demons are uncharted territory,” and that anomalies involved in demonic incidents may hold answers.

*I have this feeling that everyone here knows more than they’re letting on, of course.*
