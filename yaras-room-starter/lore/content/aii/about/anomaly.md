> There are things in this world that defy the rules society has deemed “normal.”  We often classify these things as *the occult*, *the arcane*, *paranormal phenomena*, or *cryptids*.  In addition, ghouls, their demonic pacts, possessions, and curses are also classified as anomalies.

> Sometimes anomalies are used for human gain, as I’ve learned. That is to say, some are good, some are bad, some just exist. But one thing is for sure — anomalies that provide great power instantly come with a great cost.  

*I figure this is why the AII wants to contain them and study them, rather than simply eliminate them.*

> Within the AII, anomalies are classified by a **Class system**, highlighting how powerful they are, with (Class S being the strongest).  Anomalies can change rank at any time as new data is observed.

*Before I knew all of this, I sure was okay with eliminating them…*
