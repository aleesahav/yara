Pia Du Verre (née Santana) is the wife of [Brice Du Verre](#profiles:brice), and my adoptive mother.

She is an ordinary woman—no AII affiliation, no anomalous background. She worked a standard office job before marrying Brice. He made a point of never telling her about the anomalous world, and she made a point of never asking.

That doesn’t mean she was unaware.

She always seemed to know when Brice had AII business to attend to. She just never acknowledged it. Never pressed. Never questioned. Maybe she didn’t feel like she was allowed to.

She isn’t stupid. She just chose silence.
