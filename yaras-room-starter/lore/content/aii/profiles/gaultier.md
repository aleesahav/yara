The late Gaultier Du Verre was the patriarch of the prominent French Du Verre family, a bloodline deeply embedded in the Anomalous Investigation Institute since the founding of the French Branch, [Sidereal Academy](#branches:sidereal). Records suggest the family played an integral role in the Academy’s establishment in 1879.

Notably—and controversially—Gaultier became the **first man** to serve as President of Sidereal Academy.

I know very little about Gaultier, largely because my adoptive father, [Brice](#profiles:brice), appeared to sever all ties with him after relocating to the United States. Any searchable records regarding Gaultier were deliberately removed from the Du Verre mansion here.

Publicly, it was well known that Gaultier favored his elder son, [Armond](#profiles:armond), who inherited the bulk of his wealth and status following his death. Given that, it’s easy to understand why Brice held little affection for his father.<!-- pagebreak -->


The only trace I found of Gaultier in Brice’s study was a single letter—dated sometime after Brice had already left France—alongside a French newspaper clipping announcing Gaultier’s death two years later.

The letter read, in French:

> *My son,*  
> *I am sorry that you felt the need to leave your family. I often wonder—would you return to me if I were on my deathbed? Whether that day comes sooner or later, know this: what you believed growing up—that I preferred Armond over you—was an understandable conclusion, but it was not true. It will be up to you whether you believe me. If you do, grant me the grace of saying goodbye to you in person should I die from this illness.*

I don’t know if Brice ever returned to France to say goodbye.
