Soojin Du Verre (née Yoon) is the wife of [Armond Du Verre](#profiles:armond) and the mother of [Luciana Yoon Du Verre](#profiles:luciana).

Born to a Korean-Japanese family, Soojin was primarily raised in Japan. Her mother was an alumna of [Sidereal Academy](#branches:sidereal), which inspired Soojin to attend the all-women AII branch herself. After graduating, she remained within the Institute in France as a researcher.

She met Armond while working in the AII’s [Department of Anomalous Genetic Research (DAGR)](#departments:dagr), traveling frequently between the French and Japanese branches. It was rumored at the time that she was involved in a clandestine internal project.

They married after several years and had a child in 1994. Soojin continued splitting her time between France and Japan until 2002, when she was assigned to Japan with Luciana. That same year, Luciana fell gravely ill.

Soojin took extended leave to care for her daughter, and as Luciana’s recovery proved long-term, it was recommended they remain in Japan where her treatment had been established. They settled there while Armond continued working in France.<!-- pagebreak -->

During this period, much changed. The patriarch [Gaultier](#profiles:gaultier) died. Armond rose to power. [Brice](#profiles:brice) left for America.

Soojin never returned to her work with the AII.

After Luciana recovered at eighteen, mother and daughter returned to France, where Luciana enrolled early at Sidereal Academy. Since then, Soojin has managed Du Verre family affairs that Armond cannot attend to while overseeing Sidereal Academy.

I’ve never met her. Luciana doesn’t speak much about her family, and I don’t ask. Interestingly enough, though, Brice has a box labelled "Soojin" hidden within his study. When I tried to open it, it seemed to have been sealed anomolously, with no ordinary key able to open it. Only he could open it.
