Armond Du Verre is the first son of patriarch [Gaultier Du Verre](#profiles:gaultier), the elder brother of [Brice Du Verre](#profiles:brice), husband to [Soojin Yoon](#profiles:soojin), and father to [Luciana Yoon Du Verre](#profiles:luciana).

A French nobleman, Armond is the current President of [Sidereal Academy](#branches:sidereal), a position passed to him upon Gaultier’s death ten years ago. In contrast to his father, Armond’s leadership style is often described as *elegant* and *mystic*—whatever that’s supposed to mean.

There are rumors that he intends to groom Luciana as his successor. Luciana scoffed at the idea once, saying:

> “The bastard only wants to use me as a figurehead because Gaultier ruined the all-woman line of Presidents when he took over. Pass.”

I haven’t met Armond personally, and Brice rarely speaks about him. Everything I’ve managed to dig up about him hasn’t been particularly compelling.
