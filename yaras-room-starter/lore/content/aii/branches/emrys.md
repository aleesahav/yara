> Emrys is the British branch of the Institute.

> I don't know much about Emrys, except they are considered the sister school to Darkwick. The Ghoul Lucas Errant transferred to Darkwick in his second year, and was reportedly the only ghoul at Emrys. Transfers are uncommon.

*Interesting. I was expelled for becoming a so-called ghoul and sent to Darkwick as a punishment, but Errant wasn’t. I wonder if this has to do with Emrys being a sister school to Darkwick..?*

> Similar to Darkwick, Emrys has a House system classification where students are expected to complete activities together. Per Lucas, cafeteria tables were laid out with meals prior to students sitting down to eat.
