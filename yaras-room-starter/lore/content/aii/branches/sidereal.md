Hidden in the shadow of the highest peak of the Pyrenees mountain range and shrouded in a mist of twilight, **Sidereal Academy** serves as the French branch of the Anomalous Investigation Institute. This prestigious academy functions as both a research and educational facility, emphasizing the uncovering of truths within the anomalous world and the management of its negative influence on society across Europe.

Although small in size, Sidereal Academy is renowned for its **exclusively female enrollment and staff**, unique to the other branches of the AII. Its influence across Europe is rooted in elegance and grace; the stars and boundless night sky serve not merely as aesthetic motifs, but as guiding ideals in the Academy’s unwavering pursuit of the extraordinary.

Students are sorted into **six Houses** upon admission, each named for a constellation that represents a distinct facet of human potential.

Its current president is [Armond Du Verre](#profiles:armond), son of the late and first male president, [Gaultier Du Verre](#profiles:gaultier).<!-- pagebreak -->

## Recruitment and Admissions

Like Aether Academy, Sidereal’s recruitment and admissions process is nearly identical. The academy is highly selective yet firmly rooted in meritocracy, admitting only those who excel in a rigorous two-part entrance examination.

The first phase is a **practical trial**, designed to test heightened perception and analytical instinct. Candidates must uncover hidden clues to activate a portal leading to a simulated anomaly encounter, which then requires them to either contain or eliminate the threat using limited resources and strategic thinking.

Successful completion grants access to the second phase: a **written examination** focused on academic rigor. This portion evaluates the candidate’s grasp of anomalous theory, historical case studies, and established research within the field.<!-- pagebreak -->

Performance in the practical trial determines the candidate’s initial academic standing. **Containment of the anomaly is preferred** and results in full acceptance. Elimination, while still considered a pass, leads to probationary status during the first semester, reflecting Sidereal’s philosophical emphasis on preservation and control over destruction.

After admission, students wear the Sidereal sorting artifact, the Astral Crown, to evaluate morals, values, and affinities to be sorted into their respective Houses.<!-- pagebreak -->
