Each branch of the AII (with the exception of Noir Academy) maintains a **Department of Genetic Research**, tasked with the genetic study of anomalous creatures and individuals affected by anomalous exposure, illness, or integration—including ghouls.

This department operates in the interest of public health and global security and works closely with the [Department of Anomalous Medicine](#departments:medicine).

Primary research areas include anomalous-borne illnesses and curses, with a focus on identifying the origin, progression, and long-term effects of inflictions caused by anomalous attacks, possessions, or exposures. This includes research into curse afflictions, spiritual contamination, and post-possession trauma.<!-- pagebreak -->


The department also conducts **Resilience and Immunity Research**, analyzing individuals or bloodlines with natural resistance to anomalous infection, possession, or curses. From this research, gene therapies and prophylactics may be developed to prevent, suppress, or mitigate inherited anomalous conditions.

Human–anomalous hybrid research is **exclusive to Darkwick Academy**, where hybridized humans—such as ghouls, werewolves, vampires, mermaids, and cursed individuals—are cataloged and studied under strict oversight.
