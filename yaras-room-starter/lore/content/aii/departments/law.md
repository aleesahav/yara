Each branch of the AII (with the exception of Noir Academy) maintains a **Department of Anomalous Law**, responsible for the judiciary and legislative framework governing the anomalous world and those affected by it.

Primary responsibilities include drafting, publishing, and maintaining containment policies; examining the rights of anomalies and anomaly-affiliated individuals; and adjudicating crimes committed *through*, *by*, or *against* anomalies.

In addition to anomaly-specific legislation, the department provides legal structure and protections for those who work among anomalies—including researchers, professors, special operatives, students, and affiliated personnel.
