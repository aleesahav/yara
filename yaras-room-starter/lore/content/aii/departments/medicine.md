Each branch of the AII maintains a **Department of Anomalous Medicine**, responsible for overseeing and managing Institute medical facilities such as hospitals and clinics that treat anomalous diseases, injuries, and conditions.

Beyond clinical care, this department is tasked with the development and engineering of pharmaceuticals designed specifically for anomalous-borne illnesses and injuries.

The Department of Anomalous Medicine works in close collaboration with the [Department of Anomalous Genetic Research](#departments:dagr), particularly in cases involving inherited conditions, exposure-based mutations, or long-term anomalous contamination.
