Each branch of the AII (with the exception of Noir Academy) maintains a **Department of Artifact Regulation**, functioning as both customs authority and treasury for arcane objects.

All recovered artifacts must pass through this department for inspection, classification, and cataloging before they may be issued or licensed to students or AII personnel for use.

Most complex artifacts are inspected and studied by specialists at [Aether Academy](#branches:aether), West Division (The Atelier), due to its expertise in artifact engineering and alchemy. Artifacts that exceed even this level of understanding are escalated to Darkwick Academy, which serves as the Institute’s central hub for elite anomalous research.
