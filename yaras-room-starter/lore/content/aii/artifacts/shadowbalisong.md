**The Shadow Balisong** is my personal artifact. 

The artifact takes the form of matte black sleek butterfly knife, or a *balisong* (given its possible Filipino origin) capable of controlling my own shadow and manipulate its shape when I fan it open. I can create a larger sword, a whip, a shield, and so on, so long as I will it.  Depending on how much of my shadow I'm using, my physical mobility is restrained. 

However, I can move freely and fast if I use my shadow as cover or camouflage. I can manipulate my whole shadow to cover my whole self, and thus allowing me to become one with my shadow, so for outsiders, I just appear as a . 

To reveal me, one must cast a new light over my shadow to burn the veil away. 

I am not invincible as a shadow. If anyone strikes my shadow with enough physical force, I take the damage in my corporeal form. That is to say, if you shoot my shadow, you shoot me.
