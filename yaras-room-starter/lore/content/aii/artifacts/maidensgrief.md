The artifact takes the form of a straight, silver dagger with a thick red hilt. The hilt contains a living mist-like vapor that shifts and coils as if it is a sealed chamber rather than a grip. The cross guard is shaped like two forward-angled wings, bound at the center by twin ouroboros overlapping into an X. Their eyes are hollow. Three additional recesses are carved into the guard—one currently occupied by a luminous green essence, the others... empty. For now?

The blade itself is angular and uncurved, sharpened for precision rather than flourish. Along its fuller is a diamond hollow with a smaller triangular cavity, suggesting it was designed not only to cut, but to hold something.

Maiden’s Grief does not rest on my person. It... resides inside my chest, occupying the space where my heart should be. At least, that's what I assume. 

So this is where I'm stumped. In all my training at Aether West, to identify and understand Artifacts... I don't know if I can call this dagger an artifact. While... it does feel like it's alive, it... doesn't seem to exist outside my body. All things point to the idea that this power, this blade, is as a result of a demon contracting -- a stigma, if you will,  but because I don't use an incantation to summon it makes me feel like there's no way it can be a stigma. Meaning, I can't be a ghoul.

To summon the blade, I just... pause. Mindfully. Place my hand over my chest, count my heartbeats, and *breathe*, then I hear the Whispering, and somehow the will to summon the blade overflows in me. 

A faint glow then appears between my hand and the place where the dagger comes out of. The hilt comes out first and when I pull the dagger out of my chest, it isn't blood that pours out, but iridescent water that seems to act as an ethereal link from the blade to the hole in my chest. Removal of the blade causes a gradual but quick onset of respiratory failure. Reinsertion restores function instantly, and there is no wound, no blood, and no scar that remains.  The blade phases in and out of my body as if it belongs there.

I suspect it does.

I haven't used the dagger in combat yet. Only when I subjugated the Heart Thief. During that exchange, when it originated, I stabbed it through its heart, and instead of the anomaly disintegrating into anomalous matter like most do when they are destroyed, its essence was swept into the blade. I surmise that this dagger is a host for anomalies.

But... What kind of anomalies? And why?

-- 
Maiden’s Grief reacts to emotional proximity, cardiac trauma, and grief-based anomalies with heightened activity. The vapor within the hilt becomes agitated, and the embedded essence emits a low resonance that I feel rather than hear.

Unlike a standard artifact, Maiden’s Grief cannot be separated from me without killing me.

Unlike a pact, it does not command obedience.

It sustains me.

I do not know if the blade is keeping me alive—or if I am keeping _it_ alive.
