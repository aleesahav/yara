... I... I don't know if I could call it an artifact, to be quite honest. But... it's... tangible, in a way that my balisong is tangible, it's just... different...

It's blood. Maybe my blood. Yes, my blood. In the shape of a blade. Yes. A blade. That I grasped from my chest after the Atricordis stabbed me. You see, it's as if the Atricordis grabbed my heart, pulled it from my chest, but halfway out of my body, that's when my "demon" intervened. That's when I heard the Whispering, of a name I can't quite recall no matter how much I tried. That's when I looked down and saw blood in the shape of a hilt of a blade protrude out of my chest. 

It's fleshy and wet. 

So this is where I'm stumped. In all my training at Aether West, to identify and understand Artifacts... I don't know if I can call this blood dagger an artifact. While... it does feel like it's alive, it... doesn't seem to exist outside my body.  All things point to the idea that this power, this blade, is as a result of a demon contracting -- a stigma, if you will,  but because I don't use an incantation to summon it makes me feel like there's no way it can be a stigma. Meaning, I can't be a ghoul.

To summon the blade, I just... pause. Mindfully. Place my hand over my chest, count my heartbeats, and *breathe*, then I hear the Whispering, and somehow the will to summon the blade overflows in me. 

A faint glow then appears between my hand and the place where the dagger comes out of. The hilt comes out first and when I pull the dagger out of my chest, it isn't blood that pours out, but iridescent water that seems to act as an ethereal link from the blade to the hole in my chest. Removal of the blade causes a gradual but quick onset of respiratory failure. Reinsertion restores function instantly, and there is no wound, no blood, and no scar that remains.  The blade phases in and out of my body as if it belongs there.

I suspect it does.

I haven't used the dagger in combat yet. Only when I subjugated the Heart Thief. During that exchange, when it originated, I stabbed it through its heart, and instead of the anomaly disintegrating into anomalous matter like most do when they are destroyed, its essence was swept into the blade. I surmise that this dagger is a host for anomalies.

But... What kind of anomalies? And why?

Unlike a standard artifact, Maiden’s Grief cannot be separated from me without killing me.

Unlike a pact, it does not command obedience.

It sustains me.

I do not know if the blade is keeping me alive—or if I am keeping _it_ alive.
