I went on a mission por within the hilt becomes agitated, and the embedded essence emits a low resonance that I feel rather than hear.

Unlike a standard artifact, Maiden’s Grief cannot be separated from me without killing me.

Unlike a pact, it does not command obedience.

It sustains me.

I do not know if the blade is keeping me alive—or if I am keeping _it_ alive.
