Artifacts are anomalous items that personnel carry with them for use as mission aids.

<span class="canon">

Special artifacts—such as weapons—require licensure during student enrollment at each branch. AII personnel may carry multiple artifacts at once if approved by their country’s administration. Students, however, may only have **one registered artifact at a time**. During academic enrollment, students must apply for a new license if they wish to change or replace their registered artifact.

- <span class="canon">Special artifacts respond only to certain individuals, not simply whoever holds them.</span>

Special artifacts are generally stored on an artifact chain, which compresses them to the apparent size of a keychain.

</span>

We used these at Aether West and later introduced the idea to Darkwick.

Lucas Errant stated that the British AII branch never used artifact chains.

Figures. Aether West innovation, Darkwick privilege.

  

<span class="canon">

Common artifacts—such as Fox Robes and Skeleton Keys—may be granted to students, provided administrative clearance is obtained.

</span>

  

At Aether West, students who created their own artifacts or procured them in the field were allowed to keep them, so long as the artifact was registered with the AII Artifact Board.
