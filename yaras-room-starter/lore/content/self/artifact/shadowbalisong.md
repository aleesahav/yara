**The Shadow Balisong** is my secret artifact. It's unlicensed, so there's no record of me having it. I found it hidden under a military uniform at a surplus shop I was working at back when I was seventeen, before I formally entered the Anomalous Investigation Institute and it's world.

  

The artifact takes the form of matte black sleek butterfly knife, or a *balisong* (given its possible Filipino origin) capable of controlling my own shadow and manipulate its shape when I fan it open. I can create a larger sword, a whip, a shield, and so on, so long as I will it.  Depending on how much of my shadow I'm using, my physical mobility is restrained, mostly gross motor movements.

  

However, I can move freely and fast if I use my shadow as cover or camouflage. I can manipulate my whole shadow to cover my whole self, and thus allowing me to become one with my shadow, so for outsiders, I just appear as a shadow on a surface.

  

Of course, that said, I have to not appear out of place for it to be believable. Those who have the most astute senses would realize that a shadow without something to cast it is anomalous in nature, of course, so here in the walls of Frostheim, Darkwick, and historically at Aether West, I made sure to only use the Balisong when I knew I could use it efficiently.

  

I have learned, in early mistakes, before I hit Aether, snooping on Luciana, she managed to see through the veil. I quickly learned then that in order to reveal me, one must cast a new light over my shadow to burn the veil away.

  

That's when she told me I had what the AII called an "artifact." She threatened to take it from me unless We did trials of formal tests with it. I already told her what I knew about it, how it functioned, because like all artifacts, it seemed to have a spirit that I could feel and learn from. I did tell her my theory, however, that I probably would get hurt if my shadow got hurt.  I learned in our trials that when striking my shadow with enough physical force, I take damage in my physical form. She punched my shadow and I took the punch right to my gut. I never did need to learn a second time that my shadow form wasn't invincible.
